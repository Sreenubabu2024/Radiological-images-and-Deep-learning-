Brain tumors are a critical health issue, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. 
This project leverages the power of deep learning, specifically CNNs, to analyze MRI images and detect the presence of brain tumors. 
To enhance the performance of the CNN, we incorporate the Firefly Optimization Algorithm, which fine-tunes the hyperparameters of the network, leading to improved accuracy and reliability.
Automated Brain Tumor Detection: Uses deep learning to automate the process of detecting brain tumors from MRI images.
Optimized Performance: Employs the Firefly Optimization Algorithm to optimize the CNN model, enhancing detection accuracy.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to upload MRI images and receive predictions.
Extensive Documentation: Comprehensive documentation for easy understanding and replication of the project.
